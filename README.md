# Basic Repo Template

This is a basic template repository for a python project. 

Change the `package_name` in: `pyproject.toml` to the name of your package (doing a search and replace for the default string `mprib_tools` being careful to check folder and file names) *`NOTE` - This is pretty clunky and will be automated via a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template "soon."*


You'll also want to change the `name`, `email` etc in `pyproject.toml` and `{repository_name}.__init__.py` to your own details.

## Publishing to PyPi (to make it pip installable)

NOTE - These instructions haven't been tested yet, this is placeholder text (written 2023-01-19)

You'll need to create a PyPi account and then create an API token for the Github Action configured in the file: `.github/workflows/publish_to_pypi_when_new_tag_is_pushed_to_main.yml` 

These instructions may help you set that up! https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/


# Basic Setup

Clone the repo

Create a venv with: 

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Make sure that .venv is active

From within the repo (which will have a subfolder named after the package), build the local wheel of the package: 

```
python -m pip install -e .
```
